# hexgrid

Implements a hexagonal grid in Python.

Supports different coordinate systems for flat-topped and pointy-topped hexagons, including axial, cubic, and rectangular offset coordinate systems. Multiple offsets are supported, including odd and even variants of row and column offsets.

## `Grid`

Implements a hexagonal grid container class with flexible coordinate systems.

## `Cell`

I don't know what this is supposed to be. I'll probably remove it later.
